# Personal Portfolio Landing Page

A portfolio website showcasing my skills and projects as a SCADA Engineer and on-the-side developer.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic structure
- **CSS3** - Custom styling with flexbox/grid layouts
- **JavaScript** - Interactive elements and animations
- **Font Awesome** - Icon library

## Development Process

This project was an experiment to see if I could leverage AI to build a functional website in under 1 day.

1. **Initial Design Concepts** - Drawn inspiration from Figma Community Projects
2. **Content Generation** - Used ChatGPT to create basic text content and structure
3. **Code Enhancement** - Leveraged Claude AI to build out the HTML, CSS and JavaScript
4. **Final Tweaks** - Made precision edits using Cursor to perfect the implementation
